/* This function is called one time by a process using Mem_*
   routines. size is the number of bytes that you should request from
   the OS using mmap(). Note that you may need to round up this amount
   so that you request memory in units of the page size (see the
   manpages for getpagesize()). Note that you need to use this
   allocated memory for your own data structures as well; that is,
   your infrastructure for tracking the mapping from addresses to
   memory objects has to be placed in this region as well (it’s
   self-contained).  policy indicates the method for managing the free
   list (0 for first-fit, 1 for best-fit=1, and 2 for worst-fit) when
   choosing a chunk of memory for allocation. First-fit uses the first
   free chunk that is big enough; best-fit uses the smallest chunk
   that is big enough; and worst-fit uses the largest chunk. The
   function returns 0 if successful; otherwise, the function returns
   -1. */

/* This function is similar to the library function malloc().
   Mem_Alloc takes as input the size in bytes of the object to be
   allocated and returns a pointer to the start of that object. The
   function returns NULL if there is not enough free space within
   memory region allocated by Mem_Init to satisfy this request. Free
   space is selected according to the policy specified by Mem_Init. */

   not fall within a currently allocated object (note that this
   includes the case where the object was already freed with
   Mem_Free). */

/* This function returns the fragmentation factor, which is defined as
   the size of the largest free chunk divided by the total free
   memory.  If the fragmentation factor is 1, it means there’s no
   fragmentation (i.e., there’s only one free chunk); if it is close
   to 0, the entire free memory is fragmented among small chunks. If
   there’s no more free memory, this function returns 1. */
